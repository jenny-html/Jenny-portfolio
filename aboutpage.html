    <h2>Things I love</h2><br>
    <p>Hello there! I'm Jenny, and my world revolves around a profound love for video games. I dream of making my mark in the Game Development, Game Design, or Graphic Design industries, driven by an insatiable passion for immersive and visually captivating gaming experiences.

        Apart from pixels and polygons, I find joy in the company of both cats and plants. Whether I'm engrossed in a gaming adventure or tending to my leafy companions, I seamlessly blend the virtual and natural elements of my life.
        
        Artistry is a constant companion in my journey. Reading, writing, painting, and photography are not just hobbies; they are expressions of my creativity. Even plant care has become a canvas for my artistic inclinations, highlighting my appreciation for beauty in various forms.
        
        My favorite color is undoubtedly blue. Its various shades draw me in, reflecting my affinity for depth, tranquility, and the limitless possibilities within the realm of creativity.
        
        Languages are another playground where I thrive. As a polyglot, I navigate seamlessly through Italian (my native language), English (advanced proficiency), Spanish (intermediate), and even dabble in German, Portuguese, and Korean at a basic level. This linguistic diversity allows me to connect with people across cultures and borders.
        
        Currently, I'm immersed in the world of academia, focusing on Front-End Web Development. It's an exciting journey as I acquire the technical skills necessary for the ever-evolving digital landscape.
        
        In me, you'll find a multi-faceted individual whose passions extend from the digital to the natural, weaving together a tapestry of creativity, linguistic finesse, and technical acumen. As I embark on my journey, I can't wait to see the unique contributions I'll make to the gaming world and beyond.</p>
